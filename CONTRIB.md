# Contributors and Reference Projects #

We have had a lot of help making the SlushEngine and we want to give credit to all those that helped. Without all of these people, projects and repositories none of this would have been possible.

## Refrence Projects and Software Tools ##

One of the cool things about the SlushEngine is that it was developed entirely using open source tools! We want to give credit to those tools so that other people can use them as well. There are many diffrent tools that where used and if we missed one please let us know so we can update the list.
