- UEXT Connector for expansion modules
- Temperature sensing inputs
- Logic level I/Os
- MAX1164 for temperature sensor handling (2 Channels)
- MCP23017 for I/O expansion on I2C bus
- Raspberry Pi Hat spec eeprom circuit

## Basic Electrical Characteristics ##

- **Max VPP Voltage:** 35VDC
- **Max Current:** 13.2A
